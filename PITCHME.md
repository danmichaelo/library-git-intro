# Intro

- We've all been thereâ€¦ [Insert PhDComics here]
- Enter version control.
<!-- Even if you haven't used Git before, you may have used some kind of version control in Word, Google Docs or similar -->
<!-- In this session, we will talk a bit about Git, a bit about GitHub and a bit about GitHub Pages -->

Git:

- A brilliant version control system
- Have been around since 2005, widely used, won't go away anytime soon.
- Can track any kind of file, but works best with plain text formats
  (which also happen to be more archive friendly)
- Free & open source
- Learning curve is a bit hard. Lots of terminology and commands to be learned,
  but lots of help out there [VISE HUMORISTISK CHEATSHEET]
- Runs locally on your computer (no internet access required)
- Perhaps most powerful when used to coordinate simultaneous work on a project among a distributed group of people.

GitHub:

- A popular website for *sharing* Git repositories and make it easier to work together
- Adds some optional project management tools such as issue tracking
- Allows you do many of the things you can do with Git on the command line, but not everything
- Free for open projects, paid if you want private repositories.
- Majority of the content on GitHub is open source software,
  but increasingly used for other projects such as open data, constantly updated text books,
  blogs, etc.

And of course the lesson material for this lesson is on GitHub.
If you notice a typo, please let me know and I can show you how you can fix it.

GitHub Pages:

- An easy way to publish content online.
- A service for easily publishing webpages from a git repository.
- An example of a service that integrates very well with the Git workflow.
  There are more (such as Authorea).


The two most important concepts:

- **Repository**: a collection of version-controlled files, a "project"
  - Can think of it as a a special kind of folder where all *versions* of the files are stored forever
- **Commit**
   - A commit is a version or snapshot of the repository.
   - Unlike some other systems like Google Docs, new versions are never created automatically. You must actively commit to make a new version.
   - Can think of it as saving if you find that useful.


If time...

- Most popular among software developers, but can be used with any kind of file. Works best with plain text files though. EXAMPLES
- Distributed, history doesn't have to be linear.
